Jupyter Notebook Files (launch with jupyter lab):
  VAE-Bar.ipynb        Your graded exercise.
  VAE-Bernoulli.ipynb  For your convenience, development, debugging, etc.
  VAE-MNIST.ipynb      If you are hooked and can't stop.

  The two VAENormal cells (text+Python) are identicall in all of the
  above notebooks.  The VAENormal Python block is where your solution
  goes.  The same solution should work for all of these notebooks.

All the .py files are imported by the above.  You should not need to
look at them but you are free to do so.
